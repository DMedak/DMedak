# Hi, I'm Duje Medak 👋

🎓 Currently studying at the Polytechnic of Rijeka, I’m passionate about software and game development.

👀 I’m interested in software development, game programming, and automotive technology.  
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced game mechanics with Godot 4 and diving deeper into object-oriented programming.  
💞️ I’m interested in collaborating on open-source projects that involve game development, software design, and innovative programming solutions.  
📫 How to reach me: [dmedak15@gmail.com](mailto:dmedak15@gmail.com) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmedak)

⚡ Fun fact: Combining my love for cars and video games fuels my creativity — whether I’m designing game mechanics or customizing my car, both inspire me to push boundaries.
